Welcome to the personal website of Matthew Pesavento. I am an empirical health researcher with a Ph.D. in Policy Analysis, an MA in Economics, and over 10 years of experience between academia and the healthcare industry. Currently a postdoctoral research, I collaborate with industry professionals, academic researchers, and physicians to produce research that is compelling both empirically and clinically. My work combines econometric and causal inference techniques with complex healthcare datasets, especially EHR, Cancer Registry, and RWD/administrative records, to offer rigorous, meaningful and innovative analysis. I am technically proficient in STATA, R, Python, and SQL, and I have a passion for data visualization. I am committed to using empirical analysis to improve patient outcomes.

<p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;"> I am on the market for careers in Health Economics & Outcomes Research (HEOR), Real World Evidence (RWE), Statistical Programming, and closely related positions where I can use real world data and econometrics to contribute to healthcare solutions. If you would like to speak with me more about an opportunity, [let's get in touch]((mailto:mtpesavento@gmail.com). </p>

Before entering graduate school, I graduated from the University of Michigan with a B.S. in Economics. I then entered an analytics development program at Cardinal Health Inc., where I worked primarily in advanced analytics and strategic pricing. There, our team used CMS data and internal product data to help benchmark Hospital Systems with their neigherest neighbors. I also helped build an algorithm to reshape sales territories of medical sales representatives across the country. Together with my two teammates, this effort was recognized as the top advanced analytics project of the year 2016-2017 across the entire (Fortune 15) company. After two years at Cardinal Health, I returned to academia, completing the pre-doctoral MA in Economics at Miami University, and subsequently entering the PhD program at the Ohio State University.

When I am not working, I enjoy spending time with my wife and three small children. I am a wine enthusiast, USSF soccer referee, 2x Ironman triathlete, and amateur genealogist. I am a dual-citizen of the United States and Italy.
